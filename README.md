# Altar

Altar is a cloud based image optimization solution. It uses OptiPNG(1) and JpegOptim(2) for image transformation.

It's my first python project and is under heavy construction, meaning NOT WORKING for now. :/

Current state: 
* No actual image manipulation
* No exception handling
* Application works for one time for easy debugging, no infinite loop

All contributions and comments are welcome.
