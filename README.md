# Altar

Altar is a cloud based image optimization solution. It uses OptiPNG(1), pngOptimizer(3) and JpegOptim(2) for image transformation.

It's my first python project and is under heavy construction, meaning NOT WORKING for now. :/ *

* Hurray! It's working :)


Features
* Png optimization with optiPNG
* Jpeg optimization with jpegOptim
* Cloudwatch Support

Current state: 
* Insufficient exception handling
* Code quality below zero.

All contributions and comments are welcome.
